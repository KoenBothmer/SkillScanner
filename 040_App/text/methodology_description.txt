Skill Scanner processes your input skills in three steps:
1. Embedding: We use Sentence-Transformers, a state-of-the-art framework for sentence embeddings. In simple terms, a sentence embedding algorithm turns a sentence into a series of numbers from which a computer can infer differences and similarities.

2. K-means modelling: The sentence embeddings from step 1 enable us to compute the similarity of various embeddings. A K-means model was used to cluster skills in groups of similar meaning.

2.1 Training of K-means model: The training data is a dataset of 21.500 job requirements extracted from Data Scientist vacancy retrieved from various sources.

2.2 Evaluation of K-means model: To evaluate how the model generalizes to different data sources we inferred clusters from skillsets found in a sample of Data Scientist CV's. The model was able to infer the correct cluster with an accuracy of 82%.

2.3 Use of the K-means model by Skill Scanner: Skill Scanner uses the K-means model to infer clusters from you input data. It uses cosine similarity to compute the distance from the cluster centroid. This metric is reported as similarity score.

3. Peer CV Analysis: We used Skill Scanner to analyze a dataset of 65 Data Scientist CV's retrieved from Kaggle.com. The results of this analysis allows us to compare your scores to these of your peers (other Data Scientists).
