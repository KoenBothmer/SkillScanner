Thank you for downloading this customized CV analysis report. This report contains the outcome of a clustering analysis of your input skillset. We compared the skillset you provided to the skills required by hiring companies. This analysis is based on 21509 job requirements extracted from 2633 "Data Scientist" vacancy texts. This technique can be used to gain insight into how well a CV fits to the demand of employers. If you are looking for a job in data science this technique can be used to determine the most important skill gaps in your CV and to finetune your CV to employers demands. If you are a hiring manager or recruiter this technique can be used to complement the assessment of applicants CV's.

The methodology is based on a 2-step data pipeline where skills are processed using state of the art Natural Language Processing techniques (the Sentence-Transformers library), these processed skills are then compared to the most important skill clusters found in the dataset of 21509 job requirements. The methodology is developed as part of my thesis "Artificial Intelligence Driven Methods for the Analysis of Job Postings", accessible on https://github.com/koenbothmer/thesis.
